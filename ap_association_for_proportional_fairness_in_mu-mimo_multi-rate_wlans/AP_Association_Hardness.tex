% AP Association Hardness
\section{Hardness}
	The AP association problem in \cite{li2008proportional} is NP-hard and can be reduced to our problem AAPFM by let the number of antennas on each AP and user be $1$ and the other instances are the same. If there exists an algorithm to solve AAPFM in polynomial time, it also solves the problem in \cite{li2008proportional}. However, it is impossible unless $P = NP$. Therefore, our problem is NP-hard.
